### About Me 👨‍💻

I am currently attending a coding bootcamp called 'Code Institute'. I am also working as a Customer Service Associate at Amazon on a part-time basis so that I may continue to pursue my education in Software Development. Ideally, I am a junior software developer.

At the same time I am looking to pursue a Software Development Apprenticeship in Ireland with FIT (Fast Track into Technology)

### What I'm doing now 📚

Learning a lot from Youtube, Stack Overflow, FreeCodeCamp and CodeInstitute!

Here are the following coding languages and frameworks that I am learning for Front-End:

- HTML5
- CSS3
- Bootstrap
- JavaScript 
- TailWind CSS
- Jasmine Testing
- Sass

Languages I will be learning for Back-End:

- Python
- Django
- Flask
- mySQL

I am currently building projects to improve my skills. These milestone projects will be placed in my personal website. Any honourable project mentions will also be added there. 

For the validation of this bootcamp. The bootcamp awards a University Creditted Diploma in Software Development. This is association with Edinburgh Napier University.
